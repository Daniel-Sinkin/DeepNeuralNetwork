# DeepNeuralNetwork

This repo is a collection of neural network implementations from scratch in Python. The purpose of this repo is to understand the inner workings of neural networks and to implement them from scratch.

The idea of building neural nets from scratch mainly came from George Hotz's [tinygrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad) and Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) (I've created [nanograd](https://github.com/Daniel-Sinkin/nanograd/) while studying it and the associated lecture series.).

Unlike nanograd I won't copy any tutorial directly, but I will use them as a reference to build my own neural network implementations.
