# nn_from_scratch

This repo is a collection of neural network implementations from scratch in Python. The purpose of this repo is to understand the inner workings of neural networks and to implement them from scratch.

The idea of building neural nets from scratch mainly came from George Hotz's tinygrad and Andrej Karpathy's micrograd (which I used as direct inspiration for https://github.com/Daniel-Sinkin/nanograd/).

Unlike nanograd I won't copy any tutorial directly, but I will use them as a reference to build my own neural network implementations.
